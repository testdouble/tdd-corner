Exercise: A Rails app for submitting proposals to TDD corner

Organizers: Steve Jackson and Andrew Walker


# Overview

A weekly hour-long session where we [TDD "like we mean it"](https://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/).
Often in client work I find myself taking shortcuts and skipping ahead to a design in my head.  This is an opportunity to practice back to basics TDD:

1. Write exactly one new test, the smallest test you can that seems to point in the direction of a solution
1. See it fail
1. Make the test from (1) pass by writing the least implementation code you can in the test method.
1. Refactor to improve the design.  Be strict - only refactor on green and make simple steps so the tests stay green.  Your pair will keep you  honest.


Again to reiterate - this is practice and hopefully fun, we're not trying to ship 60 requirements in 60 minutes.  The conversation will likely be the most interesting part of this.  The constraints exist to enable our creativity.

# Logistics

You might need:
1. A github account
1. A replit.com account (can be linked through github)
1. VSCode with the LiveShare extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack

## Mob Programming
If the numbers permit, we'll do a mob programming style.

I found this to keep the order:
https://mobti.me/td.   We'll start with strong pairing with these roles:

* Driver: Focuses on translating what the navigator says into code
* Navigator: Directs the design/focus of the driver speaking at whatever level of abstraction the driver needs given their familiarity with the editor/code/etc ("semicolon at the end of line 4" vs "we need a function that sorts the list")
* Mob: Advises the navigator, thinks about the higher level direction, edge cases, etc.
